excellent web application developer, utilizing PHP5. He is also a good Unix
shell programmer, utilizing his skills to automate various tasks that are
required when needed.

pleasure to work with, being able to pick up new languages and technologies is
short order.

together. I also enjoy playing ping-pong ("table tennis") with him.

> I worked with Matthew as a supervisor in the market research industry and I
can honestly say that I could not have asked for a better leader. He always
strove to be fair, consistent, and creative in his management practices.

> More importantly Matthew has been a great boon to my growth and development
in the IT world. There has never been a question of mine that Matthew was not
willing or able to answer; his technical knowledge is outstanding. We have
worked together informally on several projects and have developed great
synergy.

Recommendation from LinkedIn:

> I had the distinct pleasure of working with (and learning from) Mr. Keeler
while we were both studying CS and math at Emporia. We've kept in touch
since. Of those I've worked with, either in an academic or business setting,
Matt is among the very best. When I recently found myself looking for a
collaborator on a project, he was the first name that came to mind. He has an
exceedingly sharp grasp of concepts, and has both technical skills, as well as
being an excellent person to carry a conversation with. He would be a good
choice to manage staff, or deal with interpersonal issues. He would be a
definite asset to any organization, in a number of key roles.
