## About Me

Living in the Raleigh-Durham area, I work as a PHP developer at
[Research Square](http://researchsquare.com).  In addition to my full time job,
I also co-own [Tortugas Consulting, LLC](http://tortugas-llc.com) with my
partner [Jacob Walker](http://jacob-walker.com).

I share my life with my wonderful wife Whitney and beautiful daughter Madeline.

## My Values

I have always loved learning.  A large portion of my free time is spent
pursuing a deeper understanding of core design principles, application
architecture patterns, and researching various technologies.  No matter how
much I learn, I am never satisfied with what I have accomplished.  There is
always the desire to push my skills one step further.

Work ethic is extremely important to me, and something I take immense pride in.
In an era where the older values are slipping away, I strive at all times to
maintain a consistent, unwavering adherence to the principles on which I was
raised.  My previous employers, as well as my clients, have all commented on
how well this shines through.

Being a part of the developer community is extremely important to me.  That is
why I strive to be involved where I can.  I contribute to
[open source projects](http://github.com/keelerm84) in my spare time,
contributing in languages like PHP, Ruby, C++ and more.  I have also attended
[Lonestar PHP](http://lonestarphp.com) the last two years, regulary attend
[NomadPHP](http://nomadphp.com), and participate in a variety of user groups in
my area such as [TriDroid](http://www.meetup.com/TriDroid/),
[The Triangle Ruby Brigade](http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/),
[TriPy](http://www.meetup.com/tripython/),
[Triangle JavaScript](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-JavaScript/), and more.

Recently, a developer community started in the Wichita area (where I am
originally from), called [DevICT](http://devict.org).  Having only been a
member for one month, I quickly rose to take an active leadership role in the
group, helping to organize our first Hackathon, contributing various features
to our RoR site, and presenting two talks on git, which can be viewed on my
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/keelerm84ify) page.

## Desires

While I do spend as much time as possible refining my skills at home, I really
want to work with a team of seasoned developers where I can continue to grow my
knowledge base.  My ideal job would be working at a place where testing is a
focus, not an afterthought, and continual education for the team is a must.
Large scale data and deploying code used by thousands of people would be a
dream come true.

Even though I may not currently possess all the experience necessary to "run
with the big dogs", I am confident my eagerness to learn, coupled with my
proven ability to quickly pick up new technologies, makes me well suited for
any position.
